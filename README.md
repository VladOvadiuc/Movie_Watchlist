# Movie_Watchlist

A quite complex app which has 2 modes: admin and user.
The admin part is able to make CRUD operations on a movie list, and the user part is able to view the trailer of the movies, 
to add them into his watchlist and after watching, to delete and rate the movies.
The movies can be viewed as plain text, in a CSV file, or in a HTML file.

It's a personal project made for OOP lab in faculty. It's made in C++ and the GUI part is made using QT.
